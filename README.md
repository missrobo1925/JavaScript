// Array methods:
1. length -it is used either to find the length of the array or to set the length of the array.
2.toString() - it is used to display the contents of the array as a comma separated string.
3. indexing  with either at() or [] - at / [] allows to extract a particular element from the array by using the index number 
of the particular element we want to displayed.
4. join() - it is used to join the various elements of the array but in additon it also allows to determine the sepearator.
5.pop () and push() - they are used  to remove and to add the last element from and to the array respectively.
6.shift() - they are used to remove the first element ans then shif the remaining elements to lower index.
7.unshift()- it is used to add one new element at the beginning of the array and then shifts the remaining elements to the higher index. 
8. delete()- it is used for removing some elements from the array and used in combination with the indexing method so as to be able to access the element to be deleted.
 --> it is better to use the pop()/shift() method instead of the delete method as the delete method leaves empty spaces in the array.
